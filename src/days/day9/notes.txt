Intitial State

R4
Initial -> Move 1 -> Move 2 -> Move 3 -> Move 4
H: (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (2,0) -> (3,0) -> (4,0)
T: (0,0) -> (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (2,0) -> (3,0)

Analysis. 
When moving on the same axis, the tail will take on the position of where the head 
previously was IF the diffence of new head and curr tail is greater than 1 for an axis
